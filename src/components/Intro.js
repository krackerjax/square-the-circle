          For thousands of years, amateur and professional mathematicians alike have tried to conquer the problem of 'squaring' the circle -- using a compass and straightedge to find a
          square with the same area as a circle. If this were possible, Ï€ wouldn't be transcendental. What a shame that would be!
          </p>
        <p>
          Here is your chance to square the circle, and perhaps win a prize if you are truly a transcendental mathlete!
