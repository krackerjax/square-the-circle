        <h3>SQUARE the CIRCLE</h3>
        <p><i>by Kris Vitt</i></p>
        <p>
          For thousands of years, amateur and professional mathematicians alike have tried to conquer the problem of 'squaring' the circle -- using a compass and straightedge to find a
          square with the same area as a circle. If this were possible, Ï€ wouldn't be transcendental. What a shame that would be!
          </p>
        <p>
          Here is your chance to square the circle, and perhaps win a prize if you are truly a transcendental mathlete!
          </p>
        <p>To Play:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Enter your name</li>
          <li>Click the Big Button to Start</li>
          <li>When you think the area of the circle and square match, click Stop</li>
          <li>Only one turn per person, per round please</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    );
  }
